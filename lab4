--  This file is the starting point for Lab 4.  This design implements
--  a simple pong game, with a paddle at the bottom and one ball that 
--  bounces around the screen.  When downloaded to an FPGA board, 
--  SW(0) will control the paddle. KEY(3) will reset the game.  If the ball drops
--  below the bottom of the screen without hitting the paddle, the game
--  will reset.
--
--  This is written in a combined datapath/state machine style as
--  discussed in the second half of Slide Set 8.  It looks like a 
--  state machine, but the datapath operations that will be performed
--  in each state are described within the corresponding WHEN clause
--  of the state machine.  From this style, Quartus II will be able to
--  extract the state machine from the design.
--
--  In Lab 4, you will modify this file as described in the handout.
--
--  This file makes extensive use of types and constants described in
--  lab4_pkg.vhd    Be sure to read and understand that file before
--  trying to understand this one.
